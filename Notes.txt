TYPESCRIPT NOTES

- Typescript is an open source language and is a superset of Javascript

    -- Offers additional feature to Javascript including static types
    -- Using types is completely optional
    -- Compiles down to regular JS
    -- Can be used for front-end JS as well as backend with Node.JS
    -- Includes most features from ES6 and ES7 (classes, arrow functions, etc)
    -- Types from 3rd party libraries can be added with type definitions

- Dynamic VS Static Typing 
    -- In dynamically typed languages, the types are associated with run-time values and not named explicitly in your code.
    -- In statically typed languages, you explicitly assigns types to variables, function parameters, return values etc.
    -- Static Example: Java, C, C++, Rust, Go
    -- Dynamic Example: Javascript, Python, Ruby, PHP

- Pros and Cons of Typescript:
    - PROS:
        -- More Robust
        -- Easily Spot Bugs
        -- Predictability
        -- Readability
        -- Popular
    
    - CONS:
        -- More code to write
        -- More to learn
        -- Required Compilation
        -- Not true static Typing

- Compiling TypeScript
    -- TypeScript uses .ts and .tsx extensions
    -- TSC(Typescript Compiler) is used to compile .ts files down to JS 
    -- Can watch files and report errors at compile time
    -- Many tools includes TS Compilation by default
    -- Most IDEs have great supports for TS
    -- The tsconfig.json file is used to configure how TypeScript works.
